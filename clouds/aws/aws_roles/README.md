## AWS Roles

This repository manages IAM roles and role-policies with [Boto3 IAM client](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/iam.html).


An `IAM role` is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions.

Create a `role policy` by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities.

Use `poetry run aws/aws_roles/aws_roles.py` to execute the procedure.
